# GitHub Deployment Commands

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub.com
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `birch-lounge-app`
3. Description: `A comprehensive cocktail recipe management application built with React 19, Vite, and Supabase. Features AI-powered recipe extraction, advanced search, menu building, and mobile-first responsive design.`
4. Set to Public
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/Aval1099/birch-lounge-app.git

# Verify the remote was added correctly
git remote -v

# Push your current branch to GitHub
git push -u origin chore/tests-100-pass

# Create and switch to main branch for production
git checkout -b main
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: If you prefer to start with main branch
```bash
# Rename current branch to main
git branch -m chore/tests-100-pass main

# Add remote and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/Aval1099/birch-lounge-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Verify Deployment
After pushing, your repository should be available at:
https://github.com/Aval1099/birch-lounge-app

## Next Steps After Deployment
1. Set up branch protection rules for main branch
2. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
3. Add collaborators if working in a team
4. Create issues for known test failures that need fixing
5. Set up project boards for task management
